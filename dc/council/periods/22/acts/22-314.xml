      <summary>BILL SUMMARY - As introduced, this bill amends the Nurse Staffing Agency Act of 2003 to clarify the Department of Health does not require a nurse staffing agency license for businesses that only offer an employee nurse staffing registry.  It preserves the status of businesses that operate in the District without a nurse staffing agency license that offer only a hiring registry. </summary>
