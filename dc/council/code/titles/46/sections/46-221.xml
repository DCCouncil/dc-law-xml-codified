  <heading>Quashing withholding where judgment obtained to hinder just claims.</heading>
  <text>Where a notice or order to withhold issued under this subchapter is based upon a judgment obtained by default or consent without a trial upon the merits, the Court, upon motion of an interested person, may quash the withholding upon satisfactory proof that the judgment was obtained without just cause and solely for the purpose of preventing or delaying the satisfaction of just claims.</text>
