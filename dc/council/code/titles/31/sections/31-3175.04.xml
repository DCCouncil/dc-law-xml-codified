  <text>A health insurer shall not impose a non-quantitative treatment limitation with respect to a mental health condition or substance use disorder for any classification of benefits unless, under the terms of the health benefits plan, as written and in operation, any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards or other factors used in applying the non-quantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in the classification are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the non-quantitative treatment limitation with respect to medical or surgical benefits in the same classification.</text>
