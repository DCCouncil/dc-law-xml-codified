    <text>The department or agency having custody, pursuant to a shelter care order, of a child alleged to be a neglected child shall give notice, which may be oral, of any change in the placement of the child to the child’s parent, the child’s guardian ad litem and the child’s foster parent, if any, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the change in placement, except that in the case of an emergency, notice shall be given no later than twenty-four (24) hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after the change. Notice need not be given to the parent where the Division has found that visitation would be detrimental to the child or the Division has determined that the parent should not be apprised of the child’s location. Upon the request of any person entitled to notice under this subsection, the department or agency having legal custody of the child shall afford an opportunity for an administrative hearing to review the proposed change in the placement of the child, except that the department or agency need not conduct such a hearing if the requestor does not qualify as a party pursuant to D.C. Official Code, section 16-2304.</text>
