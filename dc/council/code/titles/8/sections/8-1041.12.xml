Before issuing such a rule, the Mayor shall provide a report and economic analysis to the Council outlining the reasons that expanding the definition is beneficial to the District's electronics waste diversion activities and will likely result in higher recycling or reuse rates of the electronic equipment that the Mayor proposes to include.</text>
