       Applicability of <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-125" path="">D.C. Law 21-125</cite>: <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-125" path="§901">§ 901 of D.C. Law 21-125</cite> provided that the change made to this section by <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-125" path="§201">§ 201 of D.C. Law 21-125</cite> is subject to the inclusion of the law’s fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore the change made to this section by that amendment has been delayed.
