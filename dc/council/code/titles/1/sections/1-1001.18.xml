      <text>If a person against whom a civil penalty is assessed fails to pay the penalty, the Board shall file a petition for enforcement of its order assessing the penalty in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The petition shall designate the person against whom the order is sought to be enforced as the respondent. A copy of the petition shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the respondent and the respondent's attorney of record, and the Board shall certify and file in court the record upon which the order sought to be enforced was issued. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the order and the decision of the Board, or it may remand the proceedings to the Board for further action as it may direct. The court may determine de novo all issues of law, but the Board's findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.</text>
