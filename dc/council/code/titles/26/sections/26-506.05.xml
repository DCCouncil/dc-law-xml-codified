  <heading>Accounts for minors.</heading>
  <text>Payments on share and deposit accounts may be received from a minor with consent from the minor's parent or guardian. The minor may withdraw funds from these accounts, including the dividends and interest thereon. If shares are issued in the name of a minor, the redemption of any part or all of the shares, or a withdrawal of funds by payment to the minor of the shares or funds, and any declared dividends or interest, releases the District credit union from all obligations to the minor as to the shares redeemed or funds withdrawn.</text>
