      <annotation>This section replaces former  Section 3-114. Subsections (1) and (3) of former  Section 3-114 are deleted as unnecessary.  Section 3-113(a) is based in part on subsection (2) of former  Section 3-114. The rule that a demand instrument is not payable before the date of the instrument is subject to  Section 4-401(c) which allows the payor bank to pay a postdated check unless the drawer has notified the bank of the postdating pursuant to a procedure prescribed in that subsection. With respect to an undated instrument, the date is the date of issue.</annotation>
