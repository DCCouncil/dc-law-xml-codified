            <text>A meter system that facilitates non-cash payment of a taxicab fare, including credit cards, debit cards, and other generally acceptable means of purchasing goods and services as defined by the DFHV, prints receipts to passengers automatically, and allows non-cash payment to be made in the rear compartment of the taxicab without handling by the taxicab operator. This system shall contain an authenticated login unique to each individual taxicab operator, and shall electronically collect trip-sheet data through the use of GPS technology. GPS data shall not be collected unless a taxicab operator is currently logged into the meter system. The meter system shall consist of an information monitor for the taxicab operator that is able to send and receive text messages, and shall allow for integration with web, tablet, or cellular phone dispatch applications that can transmit the location of potential passengers to the taxicab operator information monitor. The DFHV may elect to certify the technology that can integrate with the meter system. The system shall also include an information monitor for passengers that, at a minimum, shall provide audio-visual content, including advertising, and is capable of being muted or turned off by the passenger for the duration of the ride;</text>
