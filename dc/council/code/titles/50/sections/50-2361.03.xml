       Applicability of <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-124" path="">D.C. Law 21-124</cite>: <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-124" path="§601">§ 601 of D.C. Law 21-124</cite> provided that the addition of this section by <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-124" path="§303">§ 303 of D.C. Law 21-124</cite> is subject to the inclusion of the law’s fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore the change made to this section by that amendment has been delayed.
