  <heading>Action by trustee.</heading>
  <text>When the plaintiff in a civil action is trustee for another, or has no actual interest in the contract on which the action is founded, a demand against the plaintiff may not be pleaded by way of counterclaim, but a demand against the person whom he represents or for whose benefit the action is brought may be pleaded.</text>
