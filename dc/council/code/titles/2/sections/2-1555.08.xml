       Applicability of <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-261" path="">D.C. Law 21-261</cite>: <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-261" path="§12">§ 12 of D.C. Law 21-261</cite> provided that the creation of this section by <cite doc="D.C. Law 21-261" path="§9">§ 9 of D.C. Law 21-261</cite> is subject to the inclusion of the law’s fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore the change made to this section by that amendment has been delayed.
